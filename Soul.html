	<h1>About Ecocycle</h1>
	<hr />
	<img src="Hollow Knight/Sleep.gif" alt="Sleepy Time" style="float:right;padding:10px;margin:0"></img>
	<p>
		Ecocycle is an app that solves the issue of electronic waste disposal, especially for people who either have too much electronic waste in hand or have any waste that they do not know how to dispose of properly.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		The app was created due to the increasing tons of electronic waste that could still be recycled or reused for other electronic devices. The prototype we developed hopefully aims to solve this issue.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>Due Process</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Our process is done through the Design Process teachings of Sir Khent, in which he illustrates the Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Validate processes in detail and what the objective is for each step. This allows us to successfully prototype Ecocycle.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>User Scope</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Our scope for our users involve regular laymen, shop owners, and project makers. Each individuals require some need of a problem that can persist in their lives. Regular people are in no need of extra scrap or electronics, while shop owners and project makers do. This creates a feedback loop of providing for the recievers while the donors are able to clean more of their space whilst not wasting special electronic devices that might be difficult to procure.
	</p>
	<h1>Validation</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		While our instructor's feedback was enlightening and valuable, we needed to seek more varied opinions to further refine our design. As such, we set up a booth to showcase the prototype and see what kind of criticism and values that we have in our prototype. Most of the respondents responded well with glowing reactions, however we were surprised that navigating through our prototype was difficult, and while we fumbled during our presentation at times, they were uncommon enough that they were not illustrator errors.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Armed with new information, our next goal was to simply refine how our protoype navigated through the different pages of the application, namely correctly involving each button to their correct corresponding page.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Part of why we are doing this is so that we meet the Sustainable Development Goals as presented by the United Nations, and our solution provides it at a more self managing macro level. To explain further, Large household appliances are a commodity in many parts of the world and present a large portion of the waste per year for many areas, so allowing the populace to dispose it properly on their own or seek someone who can is a much better outcome than the waste ending in a landfill and taking years before it is recycled, segregated or remain in the landfill to decompose.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>User Feedback</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		To elaborate on what kind of feedback we recieved, most of the respondents have told us that our application will have no issues in the UI Design itself, that the functionalities for the UI was agreeable, and provides the right feedback. However, this came with a criticism in which the navigation was difficult to manage despite them having glowing reviews out our design and functionalities. We also recieved feedback that while the navigation was difficult to manage, they are still willing to navigate it to the proper functionalities they are seeking.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>Problem and solution</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Elaborating on the problem, most of the electronic waste itself is either kept without being disposed or improperly disposed. This is simply a symptom of a root problem, in which most people do not know how to dispose of the waste, or do not care about how to dispose it. For shopkeepers and Project makers, they tend to have a problem of supply or materials, in which they might lack.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		The app itself is the solution to the root cause, in which people now have the ability to dispose properly or aid people while also benefiting from the new space they have after disposing their waste through the connection and communication aggregation of the app, signal boosting many of a shop keeper or project maker's problems of no materials to use.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>Key Features</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		To keep it short, our app has the ability for shopkeepers or project makers to signal boost their needs. Users can also use the app as a guest instead if they simply do not want to involve their information and utilize the communication aggregation ability of the app. Additionally, it contains tutorials on how to dismantle some electronic devices if they want to dismantle it themselves in order to recycle it themselves or want to donate a specific part instead of the entire item. It also contains a page dedicated for each kind of user type to differentiate if they in need of donations or are the donors.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>Design Process</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Our Design Process mostly involves on thinking of personas for the specific problem at hand, which was simple as the problem itself presents most of the persona.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Our Prototyping stage mostly involves trying to create a UI as clean as possible while still showing most of the functions and features that the app has to offer, including navigating through each page. Once we tested it ourselves, we found that there were still some issues such as not returning to the previous pages properly, some pages are incorrectly linked, and that some pages were unnecessary to be shown more than once. When we got to User Feedback, we took in their criticism and attempt to refine our Final Prototype.
	</p>
	<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		While I myself felt like I lacked contribution, in the end I felt like it was a consequence of an initially well built prototype as I mostly refine and criticise how the project could be better, rather than including more functionalities. Our initial Prototype was also well recieved which made it much harder to conclude and refine any new changes other than navigation. If I could change anything during the experience, it would be to be more responsible and need to expand how I could help in the project rather than mostly being in criticism, refinement and feedback interpretation.
